                <h2>Damage Increase Auras & Summons</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Summons such as <strong>Skeletons</strong>, <strong>Revived</strong>, & <strong>Blood Golem</strong> have Enhanced Damage (%) calculated into their tooltip Damage. 
                        This Enhanced Damage (%) value is <strong>Additive</strong> with Aura Damage Increases and needs to be considered when calculating 
                        Summon Damage. Essentially, most summons <strong><u>WON'T</u></strong> recieve a direct damage increase.
                    </li>
                    <li>The Enhanced Damage % of The Raise Skeleton & Revive Skill can be seen on the skill tooltip</li>
                    <li>Blood Golem <strong><u>DOES NOT</u></strong> gain increases in base damage when increasing the skill. Instead, Blood Golem gets 
                        Enhanced Damage % increases with each skill point. This means that the effects of Damage Increase Auras 
                        and the Fire Golem Synergy have little effect on Blood Golem's Damage (due to its low base Damage).
                    </li>
                    <li>The Enhanced Damage % increase from the Fire Golem Synergy is <strong>Additive</strong> with Damage Aura Increases</li>
            
                </ul>
                <h2>Curses & Summons</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Curses such as <strong>Amplify Damage</strong> & <strong>Decrepify</strong> reduce Enemy Physical Resistance. This means that 
                    their effects are <strong>Multiplicative</strong> with other damage sources, which is a powerful increase. Additionaly, Physical reduction curses 
                    do not suffer the 20% effectiveness when breaking reistances, which works well with Physical Sunders against otherwise physically
                    immune monsters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Life Tap is extremely effective at keeping summons and physical damaging mercs alive. Monster Drain effectiveness and difficulty 
                    penalties do not apply to the Life stolen provided by Life Tap. <strong>50%</strong> of the <strong>Final Physical Damage</strong> taken by the target is  
                    returned to the attacker as life. 
                    </li>

                <h2>Favourable Arguments for Thorns:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Especially for early <strong>under geared/under leveled</strong> Necromancers, the damage output from Thorns will likely
                        and significantly outperform any gains from Might in addition to still having attacking summons.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unique Monsters with the <strong>Cursed</strong> and <strong>Aura Enhanced</strong> property are much easier to deal with.
                        This is because each of those properties increase the damage that your minions take, which is multiplicatively 
                        applied back to those enemies as Physical Damage by Thorns (and multiplied again if those enemies are cursed with Decrepify or Amplify Damage). 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choke points and areas with a lot of doors are traversed much more easily. Instead of relying on a single skeleton to power through
                        a doorway or chokepoint (or using high level gear like Enigma), all the enemies physically attacking the skeleton will be taking damage, essentially providing some Area of 
                        Effect to the Skeleton's Damage output. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enemies that <strong>Stun Lock</strong> Summons like <strong>Urdars</strong> and <strong>The Minions of Destruction</strong> are much easier to manage
                        with Thorns since these enemies can be defeated without any of your summons actually getting hits in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Almost all Bosses are much more easily defeated with Thorns. This is because Bosses and unique monsters do <strong>5x</strong> the damage
                        to your minions. <strong><u>EXAMPLE:</u></strong> Diablo does about <strong>225</strong> damage on average with his melee attacks in Hell. This is <strong>1,125</strong>
                        damage to a Skeleton or a Golem. With a <strong>Level 25 Thorns</strong>, <strong>13.10x</strong> damage taken is returned as physical + 
                        <strong>216</strong> raw Physical Damage (Attacker takes damage of). If Diablo is suffering from Amplify Damage, then his Physical Resistance  
                        in Hell is <strong>-55%</strong>. So we can calculate the return damage as: <strong><u>(1,125 x 13.10) + 216 = 14,953</u></strong>. Then considering 
                        Amplify Damage, we get: <strong><u>14,953 x 1.55 (-55% Physical Resistance from Amp) = 23,177</u></strong>. This is approximately <strong>20%</strong> 
                        of Diablo's Base Hit points lost everytime Diablo successfully hits a Summon with a Melee attack. Bosses such as Duriel who spam quick and powerful
                        melee attacks are completely trivialized with Thorns, gimping themsleves in a few seconds.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In multiplayer games or using the players command in Single Player, Enemy <strong>Hit Points</strong> and <strong>Damage</strong> are increased. 
                        This means that the effectiveness of Thorns increases with more Players whereas damage Auras such as Might recieve no player bonus.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Disadvantages of Thorns:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The main Disadvantage is that not all enemies use physical melee attacks. Your Necromancer's output will be less against Archers and Mages 
                        using Thorns instead of Might. This is also true with some bosses such as Andariel and Baal who tend to spam elemental moves even when
                        in melee range. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        High level Skeletons actually have decent defense. If the Necromancer level is also high, then enemies might have a reduced chance to hit 
                        Skeletons and other Summons, reducing the effectiveness of Thorns. High Level Skeletons also have decent base damage and can reach 15-16 
                        Skeletons summoned at any given time. In such cases, <strong>Might</strong> may be a more effective option. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alot of guides recommend using Revive monsters such as <strong>Urdars</strong> because of their powerful <strong>Crushing Blow</strong>. However, 
                        some of these monsters can reduce the effectiveness of Thorns because of their <strong>Stun Attacks</strong> preventing enemy Monsters from 
                        attacking.  
                    </li>
